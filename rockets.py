"""
This module is a work in progress aimed at automatically designing low-mass
rockets.

We use a branch-and-bound search of a vast landscape for a given fixed set of
stages, deciding how many and what kind of engines to use on each stage, and
deciding how much propellant to bring along.  The search is not optimal -- there
are too many choices, so we cut down the possibilities -- but does, slowly,
produce decent rockets.
