        Compute a climb slope for exiting the atmosphere and achieving orbit.

        The result has a series of timesteps that can be interpolated with functions below.

        By default the orbital altitude is set to 1km above the top of the
        atmosphere.  This can be changed.

        By default, we start on the surface at the equator and we're going due
        East, so we take advantage of the sidereal rotation.

        This is not presently optimal: when should we start and end the gravity
        turn, and what should the curve look like?  Currently the assumption is
        that we climb through 85% of the atmosphere then start turning until TOA,
        with an angle that varies linearly with altitude.  The start and end points
        of the turn can be changed, the curve cannot.

        Variable acceleration is modeled if shipThrust (in kN) and specificImpulse
        (in s) are specified. Initial ship mass is calculated by assuming that the given
        acceleration is the maximum acceleration achievable at launch. At each step of
        the ascent, the total delta-V achieved and the given specificImpulse are used to
        reduce the ship's mass and thus increase its maximum acceleration.

        By default, acceleration is assumed to be 2.2g, which is good low down (except
        the first ~100m) but too little at altitude.

        Specify the timestep to change the accuracy; by default we
        use a timestep of 1s.  It is a fixed timestep.  Smaller timesteps
        improve simulation accuracy (until we start to build up numerical error),
        but take longer.  This uses Euler integration because I'm too lazy
        to code up Runge-Kutta.
